# creep's arch install script

Yes, my custom installation script. I'm lazy, so, sometimes, when I want to reinstall, I like to have my standard install.

Nothing more to do. Please, run these:

```
git clone [...]
cd creep-arch-install
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip3 install -o requirements.txt
python3 main.py
```
